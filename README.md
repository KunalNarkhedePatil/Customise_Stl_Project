# 🚀 Custom Standard Template Library (STL) Implementation  

Welcome to **Custom STL Implementation**, a project designed to **explore, learn, and master C++ templates, data structures, and algorithms** by building a custom version of the **Standard Template Library (STL)**.  

## 📌 Overview  

The **Standard Template Library (STL)** is a powerful collection of **template classes and functions** that provides essential **data structures** and **algorithms** for C++ programmers.  
This project offers a **custom STL implementation**, allowing developers to gain deeper insights into **template programming** and the inner workings of **STL containers and algorithms**.  

## 🎯 Purpose  

The primary goal of this project is **educational**:  
- ✅ Gain hands-on experience in **C++ templates**, **memory management**, and **exception handling**.  
- ✅ Understand how **generic libraries** are designed and optimized for efficiency.  
- ✅ Explore the fundamentals of **data structures** and **algorithm implementations**.  

## 🛠️ Features  

### 🔹 Implemented Containers  
- ✔️ **Vector**  
- ✔️ **List**  
- ✔️ **Stack**  
- ✔️ **Queue**  
- ✔️ **Deque**  

### 🔹 Implemented Algorithms  
- ✔️ **Sorting**  
- ✔️ **Searching**  
- ✔️ **Finding Min/Max Elements**  

Each implementation closely follows **STL behavior** while providing a detailed breakdown of **how STL operates internally**.  

## 📚 Usage  

- 🔹 Use this **custom STL** to understand the fundamentals of **C++ templates**, **container classes**, and **algorithms**.  
- 🔹 Experiment with **template metaprogramming** to build flexible and efficient code.  
- 🔹 Study **performance trade-offs** and **optimization techniques** in generic libraries.  

💡 **Note:** This custom STL is **not** a replacement for the official STL; it is a **learning tool** for experimentation and deeper exploration of **STL concepts**.  

## 🤝 Contributions  

Contributions are **welcome!** Developers can help improve this project by:  
- 🔹 Adding new **containers or algorithms**.  
- 🔹 Enhancing **existing implementations**.  
- 🔹 Optimizing **performance and memory usage**.  

📌 **Fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request!** 🚀  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  

This **Custom STL Library** is **not a production-ready library** and may not offer the same level of **performance, stability, or features** as the official STL.  
Its primary purpose is **experimentation and education** in STL concepts.
